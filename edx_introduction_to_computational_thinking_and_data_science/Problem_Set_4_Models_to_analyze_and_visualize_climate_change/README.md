## Coursera - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python - Unit 4

### Problem Set 4

#### Introduction

In this problem set, we will use regression analysis to model the climate of different areas and try to find evidence of global warming. We will create models to analyze and visualize climate change in terms of temperature.

For this problem set, we will use temperature data obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The data, stored in `data_files/data.csv` , contains the average temperatures observed in 21 U.S. cities from 1961 to 2015.

A helper class Climate was implemented by tutor.

#### Problem 1: Curve Fitting

Implementation of the `generate_models` function

#### Problem 2: R^2

Implementation the function `r_squared` to evaluate how well the model describes the data

#### Problem 3

Implementation the function `evaluate_models_on_training` by integrating the numerical metrics and visualization for a comprehensive evaluation.
