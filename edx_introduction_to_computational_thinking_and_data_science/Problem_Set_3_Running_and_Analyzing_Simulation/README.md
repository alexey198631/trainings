- **Problem_1_Problem_1_Paying_Debt_off_in_a_Year.py**:

The program calculates the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

- **Problem_2_Paying_Debt_Off_in_a_Year.py**:

The program calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. Fixed monthly payment is a constant amount that will be paid each month.
