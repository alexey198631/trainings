### Problem 3

Preparation of a song playlist for next party with optimization regarding a given amount of space on disk (the sizes should be less than or equal to the max_disk_size).

### Problem 4

Write the missing function according to the specification:

- Assumes `g` is a directed graph and `n` a node in `g`.
- Returns a sorted list (increasing by node number) containing all
- nodes `m` such that there is a path from `n` to `m` in `g`.
- Does not include the node itself.

The function creates a random graph and finds a path between two nodes.  

### Problem 7

The function takes an int parameter and returns a Boolean. It assumes there exists an `int`, `x`, such that `test(x)` is `True`, returns an `int`, `x`, with the smallest absolute value such that `test(x)` is `True`. In case of ties, return any one of them.
