"""
A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our word-game program.
Write the code that implements the playGame function.
You should remove the code that is currently uncommented in the playGame body. Read through the specification
and make sure you understand what this function accomplishes. For the game, you should use the
HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand.
